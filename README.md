# hen-starter

Hey kid, wanna create some [interactive NFTs](https://github.com/hicetnunc2000/hicetnunc/wiki/Interactive-OBJKTs)? `hen-starter` got you covered.
This starter allows you to get up and running in a matter of seconds.

### Features

- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)
- [TypeScript](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript)
- [Css Modules](https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules)
- postCSS [nested](https://github.com/postcss/postcss-nested), [mixins](https://github.com/postcss/postcss-mixins), [utilities](https://github.com/ismamz/postcss-utilities)
- [Linting](https://eslint.org/)

### Getting started

Install everything with `yarn`, then run your server with `yarn dev` and start hacking!

### Mint

When you are ready run `yarn build` and zip our `/dist` folder
that's it!

### Development hints

To make it really responsive everything should be in percentages and inside the `.container`.

If you want you can change the `--max-width` css variable, but that's the maximun size on HEN at high resolutions.y
